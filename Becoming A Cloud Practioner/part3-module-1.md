## Topic B: Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework

### Pillars

- **Operational Excellence**

  - Achieving operational excellence involves:
    - Writing functional code.
    - Maintaining thorough documentation.
    - Anticipating potential failures.
    - Ensuring the ability to make frequent, small changes.

  Operational excellence is about streamlining processes to maximize efficiency and minimize disruptions.

- **Security**

  - Key security principles include:
    - Automating security measures.
    - Implementing security at all layers of your architecture.
    - Safeguarding data in transit and at rest.

  Security is fundamental to protecting your resources and ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

- **Reliability**

  - Reliability entails:
    - Designing systems to withstand failures, such as a single Availability Zone (AZ) going down.
    - Mitigating misconfiguration risks.

  Reliability is about maintaining consistent performance and availability, even in the face of unexpected challenges.

- **Performance Efficiency**

  - Leveraging serverless technologies, like DynamoDB and AWS Lambda, can enhance performance efficiency.

  Performance efficiency focuses on optimizing resource utilization and enhancing system responsiveness.

- **Cost Optimization**

  - Cost optimization strategies aim to:
    - Reduce spending.
    - Optimize resource utilization.

  Cost optimization is essential to ensure you are getting the most value from your AWS resources.

- **Sustainability**

  - Sustainability involves understanding the long-term impact of your resource usage and ensuring you can sustain it.

  Sustainability practices consider the environmental and financial implications of your architecture choices.

## Topic C: Billing and Support

### Things to Consider

- Evaluate Free Tier Services:
  - AWS offers services with different free tier models, including "Always Free," "12 Months Free," and trial periods.

### Pricing Concepts

- Understand pricing concepts, including:

  - [AWS Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/)
  - Estimate your potential bill based on your budget and resource usage.

### Pricing Tools

- AWS provides pricing tools such as:
  - AWS Budgets.
  - AWS Cost Explorer: Analyze your spending patterns and identify areas where you are incurring the most costs.

### Support Plans

- AWS offers various support plans:

  - Basic support is free.
  - Tiers include:
    - Developer.
    - Business (includes a Technical Account Manager, TAM).
    - Enterprise (includes a Technical Account Manager and AWS Trusted Advisor).

  Support plans help you access AWS expertise and resources based on your needs and business requirements.

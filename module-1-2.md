# Module 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Services
# Module 2: Global Infrastructure and Reliability

- IaaS

  - Infrastructure as a service

- PaaS

  - Platform as a service

- SaaS

  - Software as a service

- Hybrid

  - Upfront costs & Variable costs

- On premises
  - Upfront costs
- Run data centers
- Guessing your infrastructure and not considering scaling

### Cloud

- Variable costs (pay for what you use)
- Focus on customers
- Scale in and scale out as needed
- With AWS, prices differ from region to region because labour laws, tax laws are different
  <br>
  <br>

# Cloud Services

- Products which deliver compute power, data storage, applications, etc

<br>

# Amazon Cloud Computing

- Example:
  - Amazon EC2
    - Each needs to be in a spefic AZ
  - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3 - object storage)
    - Each bucket is created in a specific region
  - AWS Lambda - compute
  - Amazon Lambda - compute
  - Amazon RDS - Database
  - Amazon DynamoDB - Database
  - ...and more

Building Resilience
Servers (EC2):

- Can store applications like websites
  Storage (S3):
- Can store applications like websites, not advised, use
